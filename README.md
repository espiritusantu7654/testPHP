I have rewritten the code where necessary and added documentation and comments to the code. I have followed best practices and used OOP and design patterns to create a cleaner codebase that is easier to maintain and evolve. I have not changed the behavior of the application and have not turned it into a web app. I have used the Symfony Console component to include in the project for better code organization and maintainability.

Here are some of the bad practices I identified in the original code:

Lack of documentation and comments
Use of procedural programming instead of OOP
Mixing of business logic and presentation logic
Lack of error handling and validation
Use of deprecated MySQL functions
To improve the codebase, I have done the following:

Added documentation and comments to explain the code and its functionality
Refactored the code to use OOP principles and design patterns
Separated business logic from presentation logic
Added error handling and validation
Replaced deprecated MySQL functions with PDO
I have used the Symfony Console component to create a command-line interface for the application. I have also added a bin/console script to run the commands.

I hope this meets your requirements. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
